IPL Cricket Data Analysis
Objective

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most popular T20 cricket tournaments worldwide. Using the IPL dataset from Kaggle, we aim to analyze player performances, team dominance, and match dynamics over the years.

This project answers important cricket analytics questions with data visualization and statistics.

Questions Answered
Who are the top scorers and bowlers?

Identify the Top 15 run-scorers across IPL seasons.

Find the Top 15 wicket-takers and compare their performance.

Which teams dominate per season?

Track team wins by season to see which franchises consistently perform well.

Do some venues favor chasing?

Analyze win percentages for batting first vs. chasing teams at different venues.

How much does the toss matter?

Check the correlation between toss winners and match winners across seasons.

Steps to Run

Download the dataset (matches.csv and deliveries.csv) from Kaggle.

Place the dataset in your project folder (e.g., data/).

Open Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda / VS Code / JupyterLab).

Run the notebook cells step by step:

Step 1: Import libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

Step 2: Load datasets.

Step 3: Data cleaning & preprocessing.

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Step 5: Visualizations for scorers, bowlers, teams, venues, toss impact.

Step 6: Insights & Conclusion.

Expected Insights

Consistently top players (like Virat Kohli for batting, Lasith Malinga for bowling).

Dominant teams (e.g., Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings).

Venue trends (Wankhede favors chasing, Chepauk favors defending totals).
